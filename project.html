    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A cardiac abnormality monitoring system using optimized regression would involve utilizing regression techniques to analyze and predict abnormalities in cardiac health. 
    Regression is a statistical modeling technique used to explore the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.<br>
    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A cardiac abnormality monitoring system using optimized regression information would involve leveraging advanced data analysis techniques to monitor and predict cardiac abnormalities in patients. 
    Regression analysis is a statistical technique that examines the relationship between one or more independent variables (such as patient characteristics) and a dependent variable (such as the presence.

    &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Faces will be recognized using face recognition algorithms. The processed image will then be compared against the 
    existing stored record and then attendance is marked in the database accordingly. Compared  to existing system traditional attendance marking system, this system reduces the workload of people.
     
    <br>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Remember that building and deploying a face recognition system involves a combination of software development, hardware setup, and ethical considerations. It's important to prioritize privacy, security, and 
    user consent throughout the process. Additionally, keep up with the latest advancements in face recognition technology and best practices for implementation.
